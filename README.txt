Birthday Kiwi lets you keep track of your friend's birthdays and displays a list of movies released in a specific birth year using data from TheMovieDB API.

Simply click on the add button on the upper right corner and enter name, day, month and year of birth. Afterwards the remaining days will be displayed in the table view and by clicking on a name details including the movies released in the birth year of the selected person will be presented.
